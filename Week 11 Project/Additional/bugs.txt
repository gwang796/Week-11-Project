Bug 1) How to not open the data.txt file every time I had to add a species, and how to store the data
Fix: Create a struct called Species and push Species objects into a vector read from the data file

Bug 2) data.txt was not able to open
Fix: Change Scheme of Xcode to be custom -> week 11 project folder

Bug 3) Having an extra data type 'category' in Struct that was not needed
Fix: Remove 'category' data type from Struct, and remove 'category' data from data.txt so Species only has zone,name,population

Bug 4) syntax error from int value called rand = rand() % 100
Fix: changed int value name to randIndex because rand name makes system think I'm calling rand() function

Bug 5)If logic error within simulation function to have what event occur because of having species < 50 && species < 76
Fix: just make it species <= 50, species <=85, species <=95, species <=100


Bug 6)Logic error for removing species, auto it = zone.second.begin() but I never moved the it iterator
Fix: make a simple for loop that iterates until randIndex value having ++it every iteration then finally erase at it

Bug 7) functions were not working properly, not making changes to aquatic_zone map
Fix: Add &aquatic_zone to function parameters

Bug 8) Syntax error within logic of adv_simulation with curly brackets of the if statements under Earthquake Simulation
Fix: if statement inside of if (randevent == 0) I pasted a third } for the else part of the if statement

Bug 9) Incorrect printing error for adv_simulation, where under an aquatic zone it would print the error for all three water zones
Fix: add string name as parameter to adv_simulation and use 'name' to print instead of 'zone.first'

Bug 10)Within adv_simulation function I ran into a logic error of possibility of the population size of species shrinking down to nothing or rising to overpopulation.
Fix: Using min and max function to regulate a minimum population size of maximum population size
