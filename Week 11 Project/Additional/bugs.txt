Bug 2)
Bug 3)
Bug 4)
Bug 5)
Bug 6)
Bug 7) Forgetting to add & sign to map parameter, in order to make actual changes to map aquatic_zone

Bug 8) Syntax error within logic of adv_simulation with curly brackets of the if statements under Earthquake Simulation
Fix: if statement inside of if (randevent == 0) I pasted a third } for the else part of the if statement

Bug 9) Incorrect printing error for adv_simulation, where under an aquatic zone it would print the error for all three water zones
Fix: add string name as parameter to adv_simulation and use 'name' to print instead of 'zone.first'

Bug 10)Within adv_simulation function I ran into a logic error of possibility of the population size of species shrinking down to nothing or rising to overpopulation.
Fix: Using min and max function to regulate a minimum population size of maximum population size
