The purpose of this unit test is to test the adv_simulation function on its own. It simulates advanced events (Earthquakes, increased water levels, and pollution) and the affect
it has on the population within that zone.
The goal of this test is to ensure functionality meaning it prints the correct ouputs depending on the random number generated.

Tester Code:
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <list>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
using namespace std;

void adv_simulations(map<string,list<pair<string,int>>> aquatic_zone);

int main(){
    srand(time(0));
    map<string,list<pair<string,int>>> aquatic_zone;
    
    //simulation 10 runs of calling adv_simulations
    for (int i = 0; i < 10 ; i++) {
        cout << "Run " << i + 1 << ":\n";
        adv_simulations(aquatic_zone);
    }
}

void adv_simulations(map<string,list<pair<string,int>>> aquatic_zone){
    int randevent = rand() % 3;
    cout << "Random number generated: " <<randevent << " (0 = Earthquake, 1 = increased water levels, 2 = Extreme Pollution)" << endl;
    if (randevent == 0) {
        cout << "An Earthquake has happned!!!" << endl;
        int chance = rand() % 2; //simulate for good or bad earthquake
        if (chance == 1) {
            cout << "All species population decreasese" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "All species population increases due to greater resources" << endl;
        }
    } else if (randevent == 1){
        cout << "Water levels have risen!!!" << endl;
        cout << "All species population increased" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The water zone has faced extreme pollution" << endl;
        cout << "All species population have decreased drastically" << endl;
    }
}
